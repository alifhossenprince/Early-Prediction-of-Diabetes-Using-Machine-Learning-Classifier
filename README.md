# Early-Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this work, diabetes prediction has been accomplished using the ML Classifier from the PID dataset. We select Random Forest as the best classifier based on accuracy and AUC for early prediction of diabetes.
> # Challenges
> The main challenge of this study is that most Bangladeshi hospitals still keep medical records in manual form, making it almost impossible to get a local dataset to test the model that was formed.

# Dataset Link
> [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/).

For Implementation the above model [See this](https://github.com/MonaemKhan/Early-Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Diabaties_Pediction.ipynb/). (Chose the best model and build the model) & [this](https://github.com/MonaemKhan/Early-Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Diabeties%20Prediction%20(GUI)/app.py/).(build a GUI for the best model)

# Install & Run the Project
We use Streamlit to build the GUI,
**The fastest way to build and share data apps.**

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app!

## Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit
```
If you don't have the sklearn libery file then install it using
## Installation

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
